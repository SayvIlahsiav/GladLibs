# GladLibs

## Description
The GladLibs project is a Java-based application that dynamically generates stories by replacing placeholders in a story template with random words from specified categories such as adjectives, nouns, colors, etc. This project is inspired by the traditional Mad Libs game and demonstrates the use of basic Java collections, file I/O, and object-oriented programming principles.

## Overview
This repository contains my project submission for the "Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data" course, part of the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization offered by Duke University on Coursera. The course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming).

## Features
- Generates entertaining stories by filling in placeholders with randomly selected words.
- Utilizes a variety of word categories for diverse and humorous outcomes.
- Supports customization of word lists and templates for endless storytelling possibilities.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
### Setup
- Clone the repository or download the source code:
```
git clone https://your-repository-url/GladLibs.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd GladLibs
```
- Compile the Java files (ensure javac is in your path):
```
javac -cp .:path/to/your/external/libs/* *.java
```
### Usage
Run the GladLibs class to start generating stories. If running from the command line, use:
```
java -cp .:path/to/your/external/libs/* GladLibs
```
Customize data/ directory word lists and template files to create new stories.
